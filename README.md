# interest_calculator
Given starting balance, ending balance and number of months calculates monthly
and annual interest rate.

Requires the bc utility.

Usage example:

        $ ./interest_calculator.sh
        interest_calculator.sh <STARTING_BALANCE> <ENDING_BALANCE> <NUMBER_OF_MONTHS>
        $ ./interest_calculator.sh 94.76 99.53 13
        Starting balance = 94.76
        Ending balance   = 99.53
        Number of months = 13
            --> change in principle    =     4.77
                monthly interest rate  =     0.38%
                annual interest rate   =     4.6%
        $
